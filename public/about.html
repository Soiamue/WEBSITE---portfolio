<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Incze Ádám,</p>

<p>I was born in 2001.04.24 in Baraolt. I have lived there until 2022 February 5 when I moved to Budapest. There I lived for 
  one and a half year when I decided to move back home. I always felt like a homeboy. I am an introvert guy, but always looking forward
  to meeting someone new, sadly I am bad at coming up with themes to talk about, which is needed quite a lot when meeting a new person.
</p>

<p>In Budapest I lived with my best friend, I had quite an experience there, had a lot of fun, learnt a lot, made some mistakes, but 
  overall I am thankfull for the time spent there, it changed me in a good way. That's where I began learning the making of a website, 
  started working out regularly, started learning romanian once again, because I planned of moving home. There I came to know myself 
  a lot more.
