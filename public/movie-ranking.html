<h1>The FAVORITE Korean Series of all time</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Starting with action series</h2>
<h3>The K2</h3>
   <p>The K2 is about an ex-military guy who gets into the politician battle of two Korean candidates. It is mostly a series with
     a lot of fighting, but also with a little bit of romance.<br />
     The co-main female character is played by Yoona, a member of korean girl group Girls Generations.

<h3>The Descendants of the Sun</h3>
   <p>
    It's also about a guy in the military who fell in love with a doctor. They had quite a hard time getting together because of the
    differences they had: one took away lives, the other one saved them.<br />
    It is full of action, which I loved, you never get a chance to calm down, there is always something going on. I also loved the 
    "seconday love story" they had in the series besides the main characters.
